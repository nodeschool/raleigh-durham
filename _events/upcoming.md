description: We're excited to announce the first area NodeSchool event! Bring your laptop and work through interactive NodeSchool workshops with others interested in learning how to node!

You can do NodeSchool workshops from home, but the in-person events give you a chance to learn JavaScript and Node in a collaborative environment, and a chance to help others in this process.

No experience needed. There should be several mentors available to help you get setup and work through the exercises with you. Work at your own pace and level.
